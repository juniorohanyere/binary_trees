 * binary_tree_insert_right - function that inserts a node as the right-child of

 *
 * Description: if parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its
 *		place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child
 *		of the new node
 *
 * Return: return a pointer to the created node
 *	   return NULL on failure of if parent is NULL
